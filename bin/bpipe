# Bpipe Runner Script
#
# This wrapper script performs a number of small functions 
# itself but also acts as a wrapper to launch the 'real'
# Bpipe code which operates as a Java process.
#
# When a pipeline is run, this script creates a PID file
# in the local folder, .bpipe/jobs.  This file is 
# named with the PID of the Java process that was launched,
# (not the PID of this script) and containing the command
# that was used to invoke the bpipe script.  In this script,
# the BPIPE_PID is used to refer to this PID.
