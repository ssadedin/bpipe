Bpipe Version 0.9.9.7
===============

## Summary

This release includes several major new features including prelimary support for 
running Bpipe pipelines on cloud providers (Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services), a 
new [merge point](../Language/MergePoints) operator for making it easier to 
construct parallel pipelines using scatter-gather parallelism. In addition to these,
significant work has been done to dramatically improve performance and reduce
resource consumption on very highly parallel pipelines with large numbers of 
input / output files.

## Features

   - Preliminary support for executing pipelines on Google Cloud Services
     (Compute Engine) and mounting storage for pipelines from Google Cloud 
     Storage

   - Preliminary support for executing pipelines on Amazon Web Services 
     using EC2 and mounting storage for pipelines from S3

   - The 'groovy' command can now run embedded groovy (executed outside
     Bpipe) using the groovy runtime bundled with Bpipe

   - Support aliasing to string values in addition to outputs 
    
   - Experimental support for beforeRun hook in command config: execute
     arbitrary groovy code before a command executes

   - Many performance improvements, esp. for large, highly
     parallel pipelines
     
   - Support configuration for number of retries for status
     polling of HPC jobs (statusPollRetries setting)
     
   - Support for 'optional' inputs in pipelines: to make input optional, 
     suffix with 'optional'. Also can add 'flag' to add flags 
     in commands eg: ${input.csv.optional.flag('--csv')}

   - New operator: merge point operator (>>>) automatically configures a stage
     to merge outputs from a previous parallel split

   - Add region.bedFlag(flag) method for convenience when passing 
     regions to commands 

   - 'var' expressions may now be added in the main pipeline script,
      not just pipeline stages. These define optional
      variables, and provide a default.
     
   - JMS support now responds to 'ping' message with 'pong' reply
     if JMS 'Reply-To' is set to allow for status monitoring
     

## Fixes

   - Fix incorrect "abnormal termination" messages
     printed to console when pipeline stopped with 'bpipe stop'

   - Fix incorrect 'pre-existing' printed for outputs that were 
     created by pipeline

   - Fix genome not accessible in pipeline the first time downloaded, 
     printing error

   - Re-execute checks if a commmand in the same stage has executed 
    
   - synchronize initialization of dir watcher to fix sporadic 
     ConcurrentModificationExceptions 
    
   - Fix empty embedded parallel stage list causing resolution of incorrect
     downstream input 
    
   - Fix leak of 'var' variables across branches when 'using' applied to 
     pipeline stage 

   - Fix error if 4 or more arguments passed to "to" in transform 

   - Fix bpipe complaining spurious outputs not created on retry,
     but not original run 
     
   - Fix some bugs where branch names were not being observed 
     
   - Fix branch name sometimes inserted without separating period for transforms 
    
   - Avoid redundantly putting branch name into files 

   - Improved detail in error / log messages in a few places 
     
   - Fix missing branch and '..' in filenames 
     
   - Change: globally defined variables must now be held constant
     once pipeline starts 
     
   - Fix split regions not stable between runs, set region id as branch
     name 
     
   - Fix bed.split producing different splits if run repeatedly on same bed 
     
   - Fix errors output if SLF4J referenced in user loaded libraries
     
   - Fix npe / improve error message when filter used with mismatching output ext 
     
   - Fix error in stage body resulting in confusing 'no associated storage'
     assertion failure 

   - Add 'allowForeign' option to 'from' to let it process non-outputs 
     
   - Lessen the retries and retry interval when file cannot be cleaned
     up
