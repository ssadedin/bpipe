# Bpipe Version 0.9.9.9

## Summary

This release includes a number of smaller features and improvements and 
some important fixes.

## Features

   - Ability to filter gitlab issues identified
     by title search for updating

   - Feature: support for 'debug' command that launches
     groovy shell. Add debug() to pipeline stage to launch
     interactive shell.

   - Revamp monitoring of command status for PBS/Torque
     based pipelines, by pooling calls to qstat between
     commands.

   - Feature: archive command to clean up .bpipe directory into
     restorable zip file

   - Support referencing params set on command line in
     bpipe.config

   - Bpipe pipelines can now accept the first line as a "shebang" 
     so that bpipe pipelines become executable scripts. ie: make
     the first line of your pipeline: `#!/path/to/bpipe`

## Fixes

   - Fix not completely robust reading of exit code for
     local commands (sometimes command succeeds when shouldn't)

   - Fix local commands not always terminating on explicit stop

   - Add setsid by default to local jobs on linux -
     prevents some cases where jobs abort when precessing
     ctrl-c after starting bpipe

   - Fix new gitlab issues with large content failing to send

   - Fix possible runaway killing of processes when
     local preallocated jobs are explicitly stopped with
     bpipe stop

   - Fix file notifications not always incrementing and
     therefore overwriting previous notification

   - Fix notification manager not respecting timeout to allow for
     setup of channels

   - Fix possible error due to race condition
     reading read PID with local command executor

   - Fix file handle leak on some file systems with large scale
     highly parallelised, long running pipelines

   - Fix the default file notification channel overwriting files from
     other send channels

   - Fix possible error if input is referenced in details of send
