# Bpipe Version 0.9.9.3

##  Summary

Bpipe 0.9.9.3 contains a large number of bug fixes that affect 
specific scenarios where unexpected behavior was being encountered. It also includes
some major enhancements including the ability to "pause" and resume a pipeline
without stopping in-progress jobs, and also support for pre-allocating 
resources when running pipelines in environments where resources can
take time become available after they are requested. The new 'bpipe jobs'
command is also worth a look, especially the 'bpipe jobs -watch' option.
