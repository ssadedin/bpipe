# Bpipe Version 0.9.10

This release includes a range of significant new features, including upgrade to 
Groovy 2.5.13 as default groovy  version, initial support for running commands 
in docker or singularity containers, experimental cross-branch dependency support,
across the board improvements in accuracy and clarity of error messages,
robustness of error checking and efficiency, and improvements in support for
glcoud and AWS execution. Also included are many smaller features (see release 
notes).
