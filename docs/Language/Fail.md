# The fail statement

### Synopsis

    
    fail <message>
    fail [text {<text>} | html { <html> } | report(<template>)] to <notification channel name>
    fail [{<text>} | html { <html> } | report(<template>)](text) to channel:<channel name>, 
                                                               subject:<subject>, 
                                                               file: <file to attach> 
 
### Availability

### Behavior

Causes the current branch of the pipeline to terminate explicitly with a failure status and a provided message.

In the most simple form, a short message is provided as a string. The longer forms allow a notification or report to be generated as a result of the success.

While using `fail` as a stand alone construct is possible, the primary use case is to embed it inside the otherwise clause of a [check](Language/Check) command, which ensures that Bpipe remembers the status and output of the check performed.

*Note*: see the [send](Language/Send) command for more information and examples about the variants of this command that send notifications and reports.

### Examples

**Cause an Explicit Failure of the Pipeline**
```groovy 

   fail "Sample $branch.name has no variants - processing cannot continue"
```
