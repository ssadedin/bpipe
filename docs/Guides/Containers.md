## Docker and Singularity Support

## Introduction

Using container systems such as Docker and Singularity is an increasingly common
way to encapsulate dependencies and improve portability of pipelines. While it is 
straightforward to simply alter you commands to run inside containers directly 
within your Bpipe scripts, this makes the pipeline specific to and dependent on using 
a specific container technology which actually makes it less portable. It can also
be awkward to have to repetitively supply all the necessary arguments to the container 
runtime to ensure required storage is made available to the container. Therefore
Bpipe provides support to specify the container runtime as part of command configuration,
allowing you to write your pipelines generically and have the user configure the container
setup.

## Enabling Container Use

To configure a command to run inside a container, add the `container` key to its 
configuration, with subkeys `type` and `image` specifying the container runtime to use (`singularity` or `docker`), 
and the name of the container image. It is expected that these are available within the execution environment.

**Example: Run Command in Ubuntu 14.04 Image**

```groovy
commands {
    my_command {
        container {
            type='docker'
            image='ubuntu:14.04'
        }
    }
}
```

Then in your Bpipe script:

```groovy
my_stage = {
    exec "echo 'hello world'","my_command"
}

run { my_stage }
```

**Example: Run VEP in Singularity Container**

```groovy
commands {
    vep {
        container {
            type='singularity'
            image='vep.sif'
        }
    }
}
```

Then in your Bpipe script:

```groovy
annotate_vcf = {
    exec "vep ... "
}

run { annotate_vcf }
```

Note that the command itself does not have any reference to container settings, which 
is what allows you to create portable pipeline scripts that can run inside or outside of
a container system.

You can cause all commands to run containerised by setting it as a root property:

```groovy
container {
    type='docker'
    image='ubuntu:14.04'
}
```

## Container Entry Points

An important aspect of containers relates to how the command is actually run inside the container.
The most common way to build containers is to have a container encapsulate a specific command, 
such that `docker run <image>` effectively substitutes for running the same command locally.

This approach, however, is difficult to incorporate into a pipeline without injecting container
specific logic into the commands themselves, because Bpipe cannot know which part of the command
you have specified should be replaced by the `docker run`.

To make it easier to generalise pipelines, by default, Bpipe *does not* use the default
entry point provided by containers, and instead, configures the runtime to execute
the explicit command that you provide.

A result of this is that if your container provides a complex or custom entrypoint that is necessary
for commands to work, you may need to trigger this yourself. For example,
if the target executable is not in the default path provided by the container environment,
you might need to resolve the absolute path of the executable and supply that in your pipeline
script.

For docker containers, you can add two configuration parameters to your container if you 
need to customise this:

- entryPoint : a String specifying the entry point to use. use "default" to cause
  bpipe to use the default entrypoint specified by the container
- command : a String or list of strings specifying the shell command used to launch
            commands within containers. By default, Bpipe launches commands by
            passing them to `/bin/sh -e`.

### Image References

The image property fo the configuration is passed directly to the container runtime. This means
you can use either remote image URLs that will be pulled and built automatically or you can pass
a locally resolved image path (for example, for Singularity, you can pass the absolute path 
to a SIF file).

As a convenience, with Singularity if the image path is a file path and is not resolved relative
to the current directory or as an absolute path, Bpipe will also check within the
`containers` directory within the direcotry that the pipeline script resides. This allows you 
to ship a `containers` directory with your pipeline that contains all the images needed for it to
run.

## Reusing Container Configurations

In some situations you may wish to use the same container settings across many commands.

To do this, create a `containers` section in your configuration. Inside, create subkeys that
name reusable container settings. You may then use these names as values for the `container`
key for your commands.

**Example: Use Ubuntu 14.04 for Two Different commands**

```groovy
commands {
    hello { container='ubuntu' }
    world { container='ubuntu' }
}

containers {
    ubuntu {
        type='singularity'
        image='ubuntu:14.04'
    }
}
```

## Binding Storage

Without any special configuration, the storage available to the container runtime will follow the 
defaults that apply to the container system. Additionally, Bpipe will bind the current working directory
into the container.

To bind other storage storage into your container, configure them first as file systems with the `bind` type:

```groovy
filesystems {
    reference_data {
        type='bind'
        base='/storage/reference_data'
    }
}
```

Then you may add these named file systems as storage for your containers:

```groovy
containers {
    ubuntu {
        type='singularity'
        image='ubuntu:14.04'
        storage='reference_data'
    }
}
```

When configured this way, Bpipe will add the required instructions to bind the paths into your
container.


## Specifying Platform

If you want to use a container for a different platform than would be selected by default,
when using docker you can add a `platform` attribute to the container configuration.

For example, to use the `delly` container image for amd64 on Apple Silicon:

```groovy
    delly {
        type='docker'
        image='dellytools/delly'
        platform='linux/amd64'
        shell='/bin/sh'
       }
   }
```

Note that it is also required to specify the shell as `/bin/sh` as the container does not include
`bash`.


## Docker Options

You may run into permissions errors when the default user inside the container you are running
has conflicting permissions to that of the user outside.

You can cause Bpipe to set the current user's uid as the user inside the container by adding
the `inherit_user` setting to the container config:

```groovy
    delly {
        type='docker'
        image='dellytools/delly'
        inherit_user=true
       }
   }
```



## Custom Singularity Options

You may specify arbitrary options to singularity (not docker) container commands by setting the
`execOptions` property in the container configuration. For example, the following configuration
adds the `--nv` option required to access GPUs within singularity containers:

```grooovy
container {
    type='singularity'
    execOptions="--nv"
}
```

### Custom path to singularity executable / apptainer

If you use apptainer instead of singularity, or if you want to specify
a custom path to the singularity executable, you can do that with the
`singularityExecutable` option:

```
singularityExecutable="apptainer"
```


## Anaconda (conda)

Although not strictly a container platform, Anaconda is also often used to create isolated
environments for commands to run in. Bootstrapping an Anaconda environment within a command
can be awkward without damaging the portability of the command, so Bpipe supports
basic activation of conda environments through command level configuration.

To cause Bpipe to inject bootstrapping shell code to enable Anaconda to work as well
as activation of a specific Anaconda environment, add a `conda_env` attribute to the
command configuration. For example:

```groovy
conda_env = 'gcp'
```

By default, the environment will be selected relative to the `conda` executable found in the PATH.
You may wish to specify the absolute path to the conda installation so that the user's
environment does not alter which environment is used. This can be done using the `conda` 
configuration in Bpipe configuration:

```
conda {
    executable = '/home/bob/anaconda/bin/conda'
}
```

Note that conda environment support is implemented by prefixing your command with
additional script contents to cause activation of the anaconda environment. In 
some contexts this could interact with your actual command or alter things like
line numbers reported in error messages.
