/**
 * Responsible for printing messages to the main output log, allowing
 * some messages to be buffered until explicitly flushed, or an
 * auto-flushed messages is printed.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of buffering is to allow messages to be pre-emptively added,
 * but not ever be flushed if a command doesn't actually
 * get executed. That in turn is a workaround for the 
 * problem that the pipeline doesn't really skip a 
 * whole stage in many cases, it only actually skips
 * the commands, which makes it hard for a user to 
 * output a message that only appears when the commands
 * are going to be executed.
