 /**
  * An executor that starts a single job that can be reused by 
  * multiple commands.
  * <p>
  * The PooledExecutor starts a job which sits idle until it is 
  * passed a command to run. A command is passed by writing a file in a
  * specific format to its commandtmp directory. When this file appears, 
  * the pooled executor picks it up and executes it.
  * <p>
  * Terminology:
  *  <li>Host command - the permanently running command that sits idle until 
  *      a job runs.
  *  <li>Hosted command - the actual job commands that are doing the work. The
  *      host command executes the hosted commands.
